## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

HTML:

-   Use `aria-label` for non-semantic elements, such as `<span>` and `<div>`, that include content for the user. This will be used by assistive technologies to tell the user about the type of the content it contains.
    -   Doesn't apply to decorative/styling elements.
-   Use `tabindex="0` for elements that have self-contained content such as `article`.
    -   Enables navigation to the element through tabbing.

### Continued development

-   CSS flexbox and grid
-   Other layout material
